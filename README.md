# Dijkstra_Visualization - NOT STARTED
Visualization of the process taken by Dijkstra's algorithm written in python.

Dijkstra's Algorithm:
    -> Used on directed weighted graphs (all weights nonnegative) 
    -> Makes use of a Min-Priority-Queue
    -> Min-Priority-Queue is implemented through a Min-Heap

Visualization:
