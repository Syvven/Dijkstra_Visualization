// TODO: 
    -> Implement Min-Priority-Queue
        -> Figure out how to actually implement
        -> Array or Nodes?
        -> Do I care minimizing runtime as much as possible?
    -> Implement Dijkstra Algorithm
        -> Use Min-Priority-Queue
    -> Implement Visualization of the Process
        -> Turtle? PyGame?
        -> Make Visualization of graph
        -> Update Visualization as the algorithm progresses
